# Work_Timer
A small (Windows) tool to track how much you work and how many pauses you make.
Programmed in python 3.8. All packages are listed in the header and can be downloaded via pip install "package name". 

The tool opens a tkinter based gui, to track productivity. When closed via a click on the x-Button, it gets minimized to the system tray, from which it can be called up again. 
Using pyinstall, it can be turned into a console free program.
